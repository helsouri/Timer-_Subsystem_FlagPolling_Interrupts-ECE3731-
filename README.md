# Timer_Subsystem_FlagPolling_Interrupts-ECE3731-
I aim Generate a tone (any frequency) on the speaker.<br>
I also have to maintain a 4-bit counter on the Port B LED's <br>
I then use an output compare channel in interrupt mode to update the value of the counter while updating the counter every second. <br>
